# my-accordion-navigation
An accordion-like navigation bar with a responsive layout that automatically adjusts styles based on page width changes.

#### This is a web page component composed of pure HTML and CSS, plus some small icons provided by the genericons library，and established navigation bar for some well-known websites including Github, Facebook.

Here are the main points：

 - Use the genericons library provided by BootCDN
 - Perform style conversion by using pseudo-classes（hover） and pseudo-elements（before & after）
 - With the @media query, define different styles for different media types.

Thanks for watching !
